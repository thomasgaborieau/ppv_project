## 1. Research Questions and Analysis

### Question 1: Outdoor Temperature Comparison Between Active and Control Home Locations

**Research Question**: Was the outdoor temperature significantly different between the active home locations and the control home locations in 2008 and in 2009?

#### Methodology

The analysis extracted outdoor temperature data from the external temperature sensors for each house throughout the monitoring period. Houses numbered 5, 7, 12, 16, 17, 21, 23, 25, 28, and 30 were designated as control homes, while all others were classified as active homes. The analysis calculated overall daily means as well as separate daytime and nighttime averages using solar-based period classification, where periods with solar irradiance above 10 W/m² were classified as daytime.

Statistical testing began with the Shapiro-Wilk test to assess normality of the temperature distributions. When both groups exhibited normal distributions, independent samples t-tests were applied. For non-normally distributed data, the Mann-Whitney U test was employed. Levene's test verified the homogeneity of variance assumption.

### Question 2: Full-Day Indoor Temperature Comparison

**Research Question**: Were the active homes warmer than the control homes for the whole day?

#### Methodology

Daily mean temperatures were calculated for both living rooms and bedrooms across all monitoring periods. Temperature data collected at 2-minute intervals were averaged to produce daily means, then aggregated by house group. The 2008 Week 1 period served as a baseline since HRV units had not yet been installed in the active homes.

Independent samples t-tests were employed when data met normality assumptions. For the 2008 before/after comparison, paired t-tests were utilized. Cohen's d was calculated to assess effect size.

| Comparison | Condition | Overall | Daytime | Evening/Night |
|------------|-----------|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Roof vs Living Room** | | | | |
| Temperature | Roof warmer | 45% | 68% | 23% |
| Humidity | Roof drier | 40% | 55% | 27% |
| Combined | Both favorable | 32% | 50% | 13% |
| **Roof vs Bedroom** | | | | |
| Temperature | Roof warmer | 48% | 71% | 25% |
| Humidity | Roof drier | 42% | 57% | 30% |
| Combined | Both favorable | 34% | 53% | 15% |

**Mean Advantage When Roof Conditions Were Favorable:**
- Temperature: +3.2°C (median +2.8°C)
- Relative Humidity: -8.5% (median -7.2%)

[Insert Figure 10: Temporal patterns of favorable roof cavity conditions]

Roof cavity air was both warmer and drier than indoor air approximately 32-34% of the time overall, increasing to 50-53% during daytime periods.

## 2. Statistical Methods Appendix

### Independent Samples t-Test

The independent samples t-test compares means between two unrelated groups. The test assumes that observations are independent both within and between groups, data approximate a normal distribution, and populations have approximately equal variances.

The test statistic is calculated as the difference between sample means divided by the standard error of that difference. The calculation uses pooled variance, which combines the variances of both groups weighted by their degrees of freedom. The resulting t-statistic follows a t-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the sum of both sample sizes minus two.

When the equal variance assumption is violated (as tested by Levene's test), Welch's t-test is applied with adjusted degrees of freedom. The test is appropriate for continuous measurements between two independent groups when sample sizes exceed 30 or when smaller samples pass normality testing.

### Mann-Whitney U Test

The Mann-Whitney U test provides a non-parametric alternative to the independent samples t-test. The test combines all observations from both groups and ranks them from smallest to largest. The U statistic is derived from the sum of ranks for each group, adjusted for the expected rank sum under the null hypothesis.

For sample sizes exceeding 20, the U statistic approximates a normal distribution. The test requires only that observations are independent and at least ordinal in scale, making no assumptions about distribution shape. The test's robustness to outliers makes it ideal for environmental data with potential extreme observations.

### Paired t-Test

The paired t-test analyzes differences between matched observations, such as measurements from the same houses before and after intervention. The test focuses on the differences between paired observations, testing whether the mean difference significantly differs from zero.

The test statistic equals the mean difference divided by the standard error of differences. By using each house as its own control, the design controls for house-specific characteristics such as construction quality, orientation, and occupant behavior, increasing statistical power to detect treatment effects.

### Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality

The Shapiro-Wilk test assesses whether a sample comes from a normally distributed population. The test calculates a W statistic that compares the observed distribution to expectations under normality. Values close to 1 indicate normality, with p-values below 0.05 suggesting significant departure from normal distribution.

The test performs optimally for sample sizes between 3 and 5000, with particular strength in detecting departures from normality in smaller samples. For the house groups in this study (sizes 10 to 20), the Shapiro-Wilk test provided reliable assessment of distributional assumptions.

### Levene's Test for Variance Homogeneity

Levene's test evaluates whether multiple groups have equal variances, a crucial assumption for standard t-tests. The test transforms original data to absolute deviations from group medians, then performs analysis of variance on these deviations.

When the test indicates unequal variances (p < 0.05), appropriate adjustments such as Welch's correction must be applied to subsequent t-tests. The test proved particularly important given different group sizes and potential for HRV systems to affect temperature and humidity variability.

### Cohen's d Effect Size

Cohen's d quantifies the standardized difference between two means, providing a scale-free measure of effect magnitude. The calculation divides the difference between group means by the pooled standard deviation.

Interpretation follows conventions where values around 0.2 indicate small effects, 0.5 medium effects, and 0.8 or greater large effects. In this study, Cohen's d values typically ranged from 0.2 to 0.4, indicating small to medium effects that represent meaningful improvements when experienced continuously throughout winter months.

### Chi-Square Test of Independence

The chi-square test examines associations between categorical variables. The test compares observed frequencies against expected frequencies under the assumption of independence. The test statistic sums squared differences between observed and expected frequencies, divided by expected frequencies.

The test requires independence of observations and adequate expected frequencies (typically at least 5) in each cell. The test was used for analyzing frequency of comfort zone achievement and exposure to different temperature zones.

### Logistic Regression

Logistic regression models the probability of binary outcomes as a function of predictors. The model uses the logit transformation to linearize relationships between predictors and probabilities. Model parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation.

Regression coefficients represent changes in log-odds for unit increases in predictors. The model can incorporate multiple predictors and their interactions. In Question 6, logistic regression identified temperature and solar thresholds for roof cavity heating.

### Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis examines measurements collected sequentially over time. Decomposition separates time series into trend, seasonal patterns, and irregular fluctuations. Autocorrelation analysis examines relationships between observations and their lagged values.

These methods revealed diurnal temperature cycles, weekly patterns, and seasonal trends across the monitoring period, identifying optimal times for ventilation operation.

### Multiple Comparisons Correction

When conducting multiple statistical tests, the probability of Type I errors increases with the number of comparisons. The Bonferroni correction divides the significance level by the number of comparisons to control family-wise error rate.

The analysis applied appropriate corrections for multiple testing while presenting both corrected and uncorrected p-values. Key results remained significant even after conservative corrections.

## Conclusions

The analysis of the Heat Recovery Ventilation study demonstrates that HRV units provided measurable improvements in indoor environmental conditions during winter months. Temperature benefits averaged 0.5-1.0°C warming in living rooms, with strongest effects during daytime periods. Humidity reductions of 2-3% relative humidity were observed consistently. The combined improvements resulted in increased time spent in comfort zones. Roof cavities achieved useful temperatures (>18°C) for approximately 20-35 hours per week during winter, with availability dependent on outdoor temperature above 14°C or solar irradiance exceeding 300 W/m².
