KEY FINDINGS
----------------------------------------
1. FEASIBILITY:
   - 113/119 houses (95.0%) achieved 18°C in roof cavity at some point

2. DURATION:
   - Average: 33.9 hours per day
   - Median: 34.4 hours per day
   - Range: 0.0 to 166.7 hours per day

3. SEASONAL VARIATION:
   - 2008: 42.6 ± 27.0 hours per day
   - 2009: 25.0 ± 19.9 hours per day

4. MONITORING PERIOD EFFECT:
   - Week 1 average: 30.6 hours
   - Week 2 average: 37.1 hours
   - Difference: 6.5 hours

5. DAYTIME ACHIEVEMENT:
   - Average 46.3% of daytime hours above 18°C
   - 64 houses exceeded 18°C for >50% of daytime

6. YEAR COMPARISON (t-test):
   - 2008: 42.59 ± 26.98 hours
   - 2009: 25.03 ± 19.86 hours
   - t-statistic: 4.038
   - p-value: 0.0001
   - Significant difference: 2008 had 17.6 more hours/day

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================
YES, it is possible to reach 18°C in the roof cavity during winter.
On average, roof cavities exceeded 18°C for 33.9 hours per day,
with substantial variation between houses (25.2 hours std dev)
and a clear seasonal progression from winter to spring.
